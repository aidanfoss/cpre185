printf("The value of 77/5 is %lf, using integer math\n", integerResult);
should be
printf("The value of 77/5 is %d, using integer math\n", integerResult);
because %d is how to call ints

printf("The value of 2+3 is %d\n");
is missing its integer call, so it defaults to 0

printf("The value 1.0/22.0 is %d\n", decimalResult);
should be
printf("The value 1.0/22.0 is %f\n", decimalResult);
because %f (float) is what you use to call a double
